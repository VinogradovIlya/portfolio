## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D01_01](misc/images/D01_01.png)

In many aspects, sets are used in Relational Databases. Not only to do UNION or MINUS between sets. Sets are also good candidates for doing recursive queries.

There are the following set operators in PostgreSQL:
- UNION [ALL]
- EXCEPT [ALL] 
- INTERSECT [ALL]

The keyword "ALL" means to store duplicate rows in the result.
The main rules for working with sets are as follows:
- Main SQL provides final names of attributes for the whole query.
- The attributes of controlled SQL should match the number of columns and corresponding family types of main SQL.

![D01_02](misc/images/D01_02.png)

In addition, SQL sets are useful for calculating some specific data science metrics, such as the Jaccard distance between 2 objects based on existing data features.

## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- To be evaluated, your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your peers.
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Got a question? Ask your neighbor to the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. You may need things not specified in the topic.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have your own database and access to it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at the section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id ‚Äî primary key
- field name ‚Äî name of pizzeria
- field rating ‚Äî average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id ‚Äî primary key
- field name ‚Äî name of person
- field age ‚Äî age of person
- field gender ‚Äî gender of person
- field address ‚Äî address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id ‚Äî primary key
- field pizzeria_id ‚Äî foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name ‚Äî name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price ‚Äî price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id ‚Äî primary key
- field person_id ‚Äî foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id ‚Äî foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date ‚Äî date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id ‚Äî primary key
- field person_id ‚Äî foreign key to person
- field menu_id ‚Äî foreign key to menu
- field order_date ‚Äî date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.

Write an SQL statement that returns common rows for attributes order_date, person_id from the `person_order` table on one side and visit_date, person_id from the `person_visits` table on the other side (see an example below). In other words, let's find the identifiers of persons who visited and ordered a pizza on the same day. Actually, please add the order by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_id in descending mode.

Let's go back to Exercise #03 and modify our SQL statement to return person names instead of person identifiers and change the order by action_date in ascending mode and then by person_name in descending mode. Take a look at the sample data below.

| action_date | person_name |
| ------ | ------ |
| 2022-01-01 | Irina |
| 2022-01-01 | Anna |
| 2022-01-01 | Andrey |
