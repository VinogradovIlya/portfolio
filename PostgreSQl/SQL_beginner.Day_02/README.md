## Chapter I
## Preamble

![D02_01](misc/images/D02_01.png)

The image shows a Relational Expression in Tree View. This expression corresponds to the following SQL query:

    SELECT *
        FROM R CROSS JOIN S
    WHERE clause

In other words, we can describe any SQL in the mathematical language of Relational Algebra.

The main question (that we hear from our students) is why do we need to learn Relational Algebra in a course if we can write a SQL in the first attempt? My answer is yes and no at the same time. "Yes" means that you can write a SQL from the first attempt, that's right, "No" means that you need to know the main aspects of Relational Algebra, because this knowledge is used for optimization plans and for semantic queries. 
What kind of joins exist in Relational Algebra?
Actually, "Cross Join" is a primitive operator and it is an ancestor for other types of joins.
- Natural Join,
- Theta Join,
- Semi Join,
- Anti Join,
- Left/Right/Full Joins. 

But what is a join operation between 2 tables? Let me present a part of pseudo code how join operation works without indexing.

    FOR r in R LOOP
        FOR s in S LOOP
        if r.id = s.r_id then add(r,s)
        â€¦
        END;
    END;

Itâ€™s just a set of loops ... Not magic at all




## Chapter II
## General Rules

- Use this page as your only reference. Do not listen to rumors and speculations about how to prepare your solution.
- Make sure you are using the latest version of PostgreSQL.
- It is perfectly fine if you use the IDE to write source code (aka SQL script).
- To be evaluated, your solution must be in your GIT repository.
- Your solutions will be evaluated by your peers.
- You should not leave any files in your directory other than those explicitly specified by the exercise instructions. It is recommended that you modify your `.gitignore` to avoid accidents.
- Got a question? Ask your neighbor to the right. Otherwise, try your neighbor on the left.
- Your reference manual: mates / Internet / Google. 
- Read the examples carefully. You may need things not specified in the topic.
- And may the SQL-Force be with you!
Absolutely anything can be represented in SQL! Let's get started and have fun!

## Chapter III
## Rules of the day

- Please make sure you have an own database and access for it on your PostgreSQL cluster. 
- Please download a [script](materials/model.sql) with Database Model here and apply the script to your database (you can use command line with psql or just run it through any IDE, for example DataGrip from JetBrains or pgAdmin from PostgreSQL community). 
- All tasks contain a list of Allowed and Denied sections with listed database options, database types, SQL constructions etc. Please have a look at that section before you start.
- Please take a look at the Logical View of our Database Model. 

![schema](misc/images/schema.png)


1. **pizzeria** table (Dictionary Table with available pizzerias)
- field id â€” primary key
- field name â€” name of pizzeria
- field rating â€” average rating of pizzeria (from 0 to 5 points)
2. **person** table (Dictionary Table with persons who loves pizza)
- field id â€” primary key
- field name â€” name of person
- field age â€” age of person
- field gender â€” gender of person
- field address â€” address of person
3. **menu** table (Dictionary Table with available menu and price for concrete pizza)
- field id â€” primary key
- field pizzeria_id â€” foreign key to pizzeria
- field pizza_name â€” name of pizza in pizzeria
- field price â€” price of concrete pizza
4. **person_visits** table (Operational Table with information about visits of pizzeria)
- field id â€” primary key
- field person_id â€” foreign key to person
- field pizzeria_id â€” foreign key to pizzeria
- field visit_date â€” date (for example 2022-01-01) of person visit 
5. **person_order** table (Operational Table with information about persons orders)
- field id â€” primary key
- field person_id â€” foreign key to person
- field menu_id â€” foreign key to menu
- field order_date â€” date (for example 2022-01-01) of person order 

People's visit and people's order are different entities and don't contain any correlation between data. For example, a customer can be in a restaurant (just looking at the menu) and in that time place an order in another restaurant by phone or mobile application. Or another case, just be at home and again make a call with order without any visits.
